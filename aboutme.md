I am currently a doctoral researcher at the German Centre of Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), in Leipzig. I collaborate with several consortia, such as [forestREplot](https://forestreplot.ugent.be/) and [GLORIA](https://www.gloria.ac.at/scope/background), and iDiv’s synthesis centre, [sDiv](https://www.idiv.de/de/sdiv.html), to synthesize and analyze vegetation resurveys. I use these data to shed light on the nature of and the mechanism behind biodiversity change in plant communities across a range of habitats.

The findings from this work are now leading me to address practical solutions and how to most sustainably and holistically mitigate the direct and indirect impacts of anthropogenic global change. In future projects, my goal is to build a knowledge base for the impacts of trophic rewilding on ecosystems.

I received my B.S. *magna cum laude* (2015) in Biology from Freie Universität Berlin and my M.S. *magna cum laude* (2017) in Applied Ecology as an Erasmus Mundus fellow from an international consortium of universities (Université de Poitiers, France; Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). 

### Some more background
After my bachelor thesis in applied plant genetics on cytokinin signaling, I left Germany in 2014 for Spitsbergen in the High Arctic, to pursue my interest in Ecology. During a research semester with an Otto-Bayer scholarship at the [University Centre of Svalbard (UNIS)](https://www.unis.no/), the northernmost research facility in the world, I gained hands-on experience and comprehensive background in ecological theory about Arctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

Fascinated by the rapid ecological changes in these environments due to the effects of climate change, I began an international master's degree in Applied Ecology that took me from the Arctic to the temperate and Mediterranean ecosystems of Europe to the tropical and subtropical ecosystems of South America.

At the [Tiputini Biodiversity Station](https://www.tiputini.com/) in Yasuni National Park in the Amazon, I witnessed how initial disturbances to wild nature, such as road construction and oil industry activities, can not only act as a catalyst for illegal logging, hunting, and fishing, but also led indigenous tribes like the Huaroani to gradually abandon their own cultural practices.

At the [Galapagos Science Centre](https://galapagosscience.org/), I experienced how a Western worldview of the Galapagos as a natural laboratory clashed with the views of the locals, who are not allowed to enter 97% of the island's surface that is under strict protection. I learned that for any conservation project to work, people must be seen as the key to success, not the obstacle.

In the Páramos, the highland grasslands of the Andes, that play a key role in the water supply for the lowland populations, I studied how widespread changes in land use towards intensive livestock grazing, fostered the compaction of the soil and altered the water storage capacity, leading to soil erosion and runoff in turn threatening the water provisioning services of this ecosystem.

In Brazil, I did fieldwork in the Pampas region, a once contiguous grassy ecosystem that extended into Uruguay and Argentina. I witnessed how rapid conversion of native grasslands to cropland, faulty management in protected areas and a general lack of protection make these highly biodiverse grasslands the biome with the highest conservation risk in Brazil. 

I learned that a central component of our current biodiversity crisis is due to poorly informed decision-making, and that science can play a key role in providing actionable knowledge to address the drivers of biodiversity loss. These experiences led me to work at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research that emphasizes interdisciplinary research and works at the science-policy interface.

In my free time, I play the piano, paint huge canvases and am currently building a boat.
