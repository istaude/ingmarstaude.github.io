Our new GrassSyn project with Brazil's Biodiversity Synthesis Centre [(SinBiose)](http://www.sinbiose.cnpq.br/web/sinbiose) has started:

In order to effectively conserve biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services of natural ecosystems, approaches are needed that integrate ecological theory, 
the best available data and expert knowledge on biodiversity, its drivers and stressors, as well as on conservation state, degradation processes and their context. 
Here,we propose a synthesis of available information on the biodiversity and ecosystems services of Brazil’s savannas and grasslands (in the following: grasslands). 
Specifically, we propose to (i) synthesize knowledge on the spatial distribution and drivers of plant community composition, diversity and ecosystem services, including 
carbon storage; (ii) assess the current conservation status and developing conservation strategies, tailored to Brazil’s grassland systems; (iii) develop a framework for 
restoration planning that takes into account differences in ecological conditions among grassland systems in Brazil, their vulnerabilities and their potential for economic use. 
We include grasslands and savannas across Brazil, i.e. in the Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal, where grasslands and savanna (including hyperseasonal) dominate, but also consider 
grassland/savanna enclaves in the Amazon and Atlantic forests.
