After focusing with the first workshop on a large database of forest
understorey resurvey studies across temperate forests (forestREplot), the
main goal of the second workshop was to extend our analysis to cross-biome analyses. To reach this goal sDiv brought together 
representatives of different research networks dealing with resurvey data
(forestREplot, Gloria, SummitFlora, ITEX, GRACE, BioTime), and/or of
different sDiv working groups focusing on temporal changes (sMon, sPlot,
sTundra, sChange, sUMMITDiv). The overarching aim of our second sREplot workshops is to quantify the temporal changes in individual species (winners and losers, colonization and
extinction), link these changes to various human impacts, and scale up from
individual species dynamics to community trends in biodiversity.

I am the lead one project that seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. Regardless of habitat, can the identity of "winner" and "loser" species be predicted by their geographic distribution size as a 
key synthetic measure of species ecological profile?

2. What is the mechanism driving any such systematic temporal turnover towards larger-ranged species?

3. How does the strength of the association between species range size and probability of loss/gain differs between habitats, and why?
