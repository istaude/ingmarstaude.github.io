Welcome to my website! I am working as a PhD Student with <a href="https://www.idiv.de/en/groups_and_people/core_groups/biodiversity_conservation.html">Henrique Pereira</a> at 
the <a href="https://www.idiv.de/de/index.html">German Centre of Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)</a>. I seek to understand how and why the abundance and distribution of species changes under anthropogenic global change. My goal is to generate
actionable and policy-relevant knowledge to help fight the ongoing loss of Earth's biodiversity.
