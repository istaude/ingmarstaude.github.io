Welcome to my website! I am working as a Phd Student with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>  [Henrique Pereira](https://www.idiv.de/en/groups_and_people/core_groups/biodiversity_conservation.html) at 
the German Centre of Integrative Biodiversity Research [(iDiv)](https://www.idiv.de/de/index.html). 
I seek to understand how and why the abundance and distribution of species changes under anthropogenic global change. My goal is to generate
actionable and policy-relevant knowledge to help fight the ongoing loss of Earth's biodiversity.
